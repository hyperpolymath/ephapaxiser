// ABI module for ephapaxiser — Core types for linear resource analysis.
//
// Defines the fundamental types used throughout ephapaxiser:
// - ResourceKind: Classification of system resources (file descriptors, sockets, etc.)
// - OwnershipState: Tracks the lifecycle state of a resource (Uninitialized → Owned → Consumed)
// - LinearResource: A resource handle with its allocator/deallocator pair and current state
// - Violation: Detected misuse of a resource (leak, double-free, use-after-free)
// - AnalysisResult: Aggregated output from analysing a codebase
//
// Design note: When Idris2 proofs conflict with Ephapax linear types, Idris2 ALWAYS wins.
// The Rust types here mirror the Idris2 ABI definitions in src/interface/abi/ but are
// subordinate to the formal proofs.
